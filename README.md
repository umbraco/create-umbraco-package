# create-umbraco-package
A CLI tool to help scaffold and bootstrap Umbraco extensions in the WebComponent based backoffice of Umbraco

## Build
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
* `npm link`
This will globally install a symlink linking to your current project so there's no need for you to re-run this when we update our code. After running npm link you should have your CLI commands available.

* `create-package`
